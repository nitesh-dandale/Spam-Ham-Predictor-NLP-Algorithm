Deployed Link : https://spam-emails-detector.herokuapp.com/

The Spam-Ham-Email-Predictor can be used to predict if the given email 
is spam or ham.

You just need to input any email and it will predict if it
was a spam  or ham

## Based on Natural Language Processing  Algorithm

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language 
processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is 
positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often 
performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and 
product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer 
needs.

Naive Bayes is the simplest and fastest classification algorithm 
for a large chunk of data. In various applications such as spam 
filtering, text classification, sentiment analysis, and 
recommendation systems, Naive Bayes classifier is used 
successfully. It uses the Bayes probability theorem for unknown 
class prediction.

The Naive Bayes classification technique is a simple and powerful 
classification task in machine learning. The use of Bayesâ€™ theorem 
with a strong independence assumption between the features is 
the basis for naive Bayes classification. When used for textual 
data analysis, such as Natural Language Processing, the Naive 
Bayes classification yields good results.
